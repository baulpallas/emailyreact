##Welcome to Emaily! 

This app is not yet completed, but I will finish the Udemy Course (have 2 more hours left) when I have time. This app is built with React, Redux, React-Redux, React-Form, MongoDB, Mongoose, Stripe, Sendgrid, Google OAuth, and Lodash.  
Instructions are below: 

1) On the landing page, click the top right 'login with google button' to log in
2) On the dashboard page, click the 'add credits' button the top right and work through the stripe flow to buy credits, which will allow you to purchase an email survey
    - use the test credit card number 4242 4242 4242 4242, a date in the future as the expiration, and any three number for the CVV code
    
3) Once credits have been added, click the circular $ button on the bottom right corder of the page to create a new survey. 
4) Add the survey name, subject line, body and recipients (comma separated).  For this part, feel free to input your personal email address to show that the app works. 
5) COMING SOON - There will be a feature that aggregates survey responses.  This will utilize webhooks.
